# RimWorldForge 0.1.0 Foundation

A local-first AI modding workbench for **RimWorld 1.6**. It is designed for agents that should create actual mods, inspect the game before inventing XML, validate what they wrote, package clean outputs, and report exactly what has and has not been proven.

RimWorldForge is deliberately split into two layers:

1. **Forge core**: deterministic Python tools for discovery, Def indexing, generation, validation, C# scaffolding, packaging, and log analysis.
2. **Agent intelligence**: a compact skill and docs that teach an AI how to choose vanilla XML, Biotech genes/xenotypes, HAR races, Harmony/C#, and art workflows without loading a giant MCP schema every turn.

The foundation targets RimWorld **1.6** and knows the current expansion layout through **Odyssey**. It never treats static XML parsing as proof that a mod works in-game.

## What works now

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| Detect RimWorld + installed DLC | implemented |
| Index Core/Royalty/Ideology/Biotech/Anomaly/Odyssey Defs | implemented |
| Index installed mods incl. versioned layouts (`1.6/`, `Common/`, `LoadFolders.xml`) — 1.6 only, legacy version dirs skipped | implemented |
| Search vanilla/DLC/installed-mod Defs by concept, label, type, or defName | implemented |
| Clone an installed Def into an editable typed blueprint plan | implemented |
| Scan local/Workshop mods and detect key frameworks (HAR, Harmony, VEF, VFEC, Big & Small, Giddy-Up, RJW, RimTalk, HugsLib, Vehicle Framework) | implemented |
| Emit production image prompts from asset manifests | implemented |
| Inspect source XML for an indexed Def | implemented |
| Create isolated mod workspaces | implemented |
| Generate `About.xml`, Def XML and `LoadFolders.xml` from typed JSON plans | implemented |
| Generic nested XML fields, lists and XML attributes | implemented |
| Static About/Def/Patch validation | implemented |
| Duplicate defName and texture-path checks | implemented |
| Conservative reference checks against a real game index (vanilla + installed mods) | implemented |
| Clean build folder, ZIP, SHA-256 file manifest and receipt | implemented |
| Analyze `Player.log` for common mod failures incl. duplicate-exception storms (per-line repeat counts — the `[Ref XXXX] Duplicate stacktrace` pattern Unity uses to hide original stacks) | implemented |
| C# project scaffold against the installed RimWorld managed assemblies | implemented |
| C# compile through `dotnet build` | implemented, explicit approval required |
| Stage a built mod into `RimWorld/Mods` | implemented, explicit approval required |
| Autonomous game launch / spawn test | not implemented yet |
| Visual correctness test | human or vision step |
| Image generation | asset contract and prompt workflow only |
| Steam Workshop publication | not implemented yet |

Run `rwforge capabilities` for the machine-readable matrix.

## The Forge loop

```text
idea
  |
  v
search real vanilla/DLC examples
  |
  v
write a typed plan
  |
  v
plan-validate -> generate -> validate
  |                         |
  |                         +-- syntax / duplicate / texture / reference checks
  v
optional C# scaffold + compile
  |
  v
build -> clean folder + zip + SHA-256 receipt
  |
  v
stage manually-approved copy into RimWorld/Mods
  |
  v
launch RimWorld yourself -> Player.log
  |
  v
log-analyze -> repair -> repeat
```

The first design rule is **inspect before inventing**. RimWorld's Defs map directly onto C# `Def` classes and vanilla Defs are the best practical schema examples. A weak model becomes dramatically more reliable when it can search the installed game instead of guessing tag names from memory.

## Install

Requirements: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux; Python 3.10+; RimWorld 1.6 for game-aware operations.

### Windows

```powershell
.\Install.ps1
```

or double-click:

```text
START-HERE.bat
```

The installer creates `.venv`, installs RimWorldForge in editable mode, runs tests, and prints the exact CLI/MCP commands. It does not edit RimWorld, your active mod list, or saves.

### Manual

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -e .      # Windows
# .venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .        # Linux/macOS

rwforge doctor
rwforge capabilities
```

If automatic discovery misses your install:

```powershell
$env:RIMWORLD_ROOT = 'D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\RimWorld'
rwforge doctor
```

## First real workflow

### 1. Index the installed game

```text
rwforge index
rwforge search mechanoid --type ThingDef
rwforge inspect Centipede
rwforge def-blueprint Centipede MyHeavyMech --output plans/my-heavy-mech.json --package-id author.mymech --mod-name "My Heavy Mech"
rwforge mods-scan
```

The index is written under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RimWorldForge\indexes` on Windows or the platform data directory elsewhere.

### 2. Create a workspace

```text
rwforge project-new "Warden Mech" --package-id shugokifable.wardenmech --workspace Workspaces/WardenMech
```

The live game is not touched. The workspace contains:

```text
WardenMech/
  forge.json
  plans/
  reports/
  csharp/
  source/
    About/About.xml
    Defs/
    Patches/
    Textures/
    Assemblies/
    Languages/English/
  build/
```

### 3. Start from the bundled example

```text
copy examples\warden-mech.plan.json Workspaces\WardenMech\plans\warden.plan.json
rwforge plan-validate Workspaces\WardenMech\plans\warden.plan.json
rwforge generate Workspaces\WardenMech Workspaces\WardenMech\plans\warden.plan.json
rwforge validate Workspaces\WardenMech
rwforge build Workspaces\WardenMech
```

The example is intentionally a **teaching plan**, not a claim that one generic XML block is a complete balanced Biotech mech. Before shipping it, inspect current installed 1.6 mech Defs and adapt fields to the exact parent/classes your game exposes.

### 4. Test and diagnose

After you manually enable the staged/built mod in RimWorld and launch the game:

```text
rwforge log-analyze
```

It groups common failures including unresolved cross-references, XML errors, missing assemblies, Harmony failures, texture errors and exceptions.

## Typed plan format

The plan deliberately mirrors RimWorld XML rather than hiding it behind a huge opinionated DSL.

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "mod": {
    "name": "Example Mod",
    "packageId": "author.example",
    "author": "Author",
    "supportedVersions": ["1.6"],
    "description": "Example generated mod"
  },
  "defs": [
    {
      "type": "ThingDef",
      "attributes": {"ParentName": "BaseThing"},
      "fields": {
        "defName": "Author_ExampleThing",
        "label": "example thing",
        "description": "A generated example.",
        "statBases": {
          "MaxHitPoints": 250,
          "MarketValue": 100
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "assets": []
}
```

Nested objects become nested XML nodes. Lists become `<li>` lists. Prefix dictionary keys with `@` when an XML child needs attributes, or use an explicit `_tag` for a non-`li` list item. This keeps the plan expressive enough for normal RimWorld Defs without teaching Forge every future `Def` subclass.

See `schemas/project-plan.schema.json`, `docs/MODDING-GUIDE.md`, and `docs/CONTENT-RECIPES.md`.

## Races and NPCs

RimWorldForge's intended routing is:

- **Vanilla humanlike content**: `PawnKindDef`, factions, backstories, apparel, traits, etc.
- **Biotech**: `GeneDef` + `XenotypeDef` when the concept can be expressed through genes.
- **Humanoid Alien Races**: XML-driven custom race bodies/graphics/restrictions when HAR is the right dependency.
- **C# / Harmony**: only when the behavior cannot be represented cleanly with Defs or an established framework.

HAR currently declares RimWorld 1.6 support and remains a natural route for full custom humanoid races. RimWorldForge does not vendor HAR or Harmony.

## Art pipeline

RimWorld mod art is not "generate one pretty picture and call it done." Pawn, apparel, weapon, building, UI and preview assets each have different framing and directional requirements.

Plans can declare assets:

```json
{
  "id": "warden_body",
  "kind": "pawn_directional",
  "target": "Textures/Shugoki/Warden/Warden_south.png",
  "transparent": true,
  "style": "RimWorld-compatible top-down pawn sprite",
  "directions": ["south", "north", "east"],
  "notes": "west may be mirrored only if the design is symmetric"
}
```

`ASSETS-NEEDED.json` is generated into the workspace. `rwforge art-prompts <workspace>` turns every asset brief into a production prompt file. An AI with image generation can consume those prompts, create the assets, normalize/crop them, and then rerun `rwforge validate`.

The bundled `examples/art/warden-concept.svg` is **concept/reference art only**, not a game-ready pawn texture. `docs/ART-PIPELINE.md` explains the contract.

## C# escalation

```text
rwforge csharp-scaffold Workspaces/MyMod
rwforge csharp-build Workspaces/MyMod --approve
```

The scaffold references the managed assemblies from the detected game and targets `net472`, a common RimWorld mod baseline. External compilation is approval-gated because it launches a compiler. Harmony is optional and must be supplied explicitly with `--harmony-dll` if a project needs it.

## MCP

The MCP façade intentionally stays at only 11 broad tools. Expert helpers such as Def blueprints, mod/framework scans, C# compilation and art-prompt emission remain CLI/skill operations so they do not inflate every MCP turn:

```text
rw_doctor
rw_capabilities
rw_index
rw_def_search
rw_def_inspect
rw_project_new
rw_plan_validate
rw_generate
rw_validate
rw_build
rw_log_analyze
```

Start it with:

```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe mcp_server\server.py
```

It uses a tiny stdio JSON-RPC implementation and no external MCP SDK. Keep it disabled outside RimWorld work to preserve prompt context. The companion skill carries the workflow intelligence so the MCP does not need dozens of micro-tools.

## Evidence tiers

RimWorldForge never collapses these into one fake green check:

1. `syntax_valid`: Forge could parse and structurally inspect the files.
2. `references_valid`: conservative references were checked against a real installed-game index.
3. `compiled`: C# compiler accepted the project and a DLL was produced.
4. `load_tested`: RimWorld loaded the mod without relevant startup errors. Not automated yet.
5. `runtime_tested`: spawned/used content actually behaved correctly. Not automated yet.
6. `visual_tested`: textures, draw sizes, offsets, directional art and UI look correct.

A build receipt records the evidence that actually exists.

## Current source of truth

The foundation was grounded against current 1.6-era references in August 2026:

- RimWorld Wiki: Mod Folder Structure, About.xml, XML Defs, XML file structure
- Ludeon Studios: RimWorld 1.6 and current update announcements
- Humanoid Alien Races repository: 1.6 support declaration and XML-focused feature set

See `knowledge/SOURCES.md` for the URLs and what each source is allowed to prove.

## Roadmap to 1.0

The next high-value work is deliberately runtime-heavy rather than adding 80 more generator templates:

- controlled temporary ModsConfig generation
- launch-and-watch test profile
- parse only errors attributable to the generated packageId
- developer-mode spawn/instantiate test harness
- screenshot capture + vision inspection for art offsets and clipping
- stronger reflection-backed C# field/schema extraction
- HAR helper plans and Biotech xenotype helpers built from installed examples
- Steam Workshop packaging/publishing as a separate trust gate
- benchmark: weak local model, same mod prompt, baseline vs Forge

The foundation is useful now, but 1.0 should mean **proved behavioral improvement and a full automated load-test loop**, not a larger README.
